I am an Undergraduate Student Majoring in Mathematics with a Minor in Computer Science at IISER Berhampur. I am currently doing my Masterâ€™s Thesis Research work at IIT Hyderabad with [Dr.Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home?authuser=0) at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Generative Models.

**Research,** I am interested in working on Zero-shot Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning models that can adapt to downstream tasks with the prospect of developing Foundation Models for Decision Making Systems.

**Outside Research,** Alongside my primary research work, I have a particular interest in Machine Learning Systems(MLSys) with a focus on developing efficient deep learning models for the Edge Devices and builing better compute infrastructure for ML Model Training. I love Open Source and I spend time actively contributing to open source projects of my own and others (some of them are mentioned on the software page)

I am on the lookout for possible research opportunities in the field of Deep Reinforcement learning. Feel free to connect with me to discuss potential collaborations, research opportunities and Cool Open Source Project Ideas.
